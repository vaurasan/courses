# Task 5: IAM

### Task goals:
- Create credential management managed service secret like dummy username + password
- Create IAM/RBAC Permissions that allow to read secret
- Attach Permissions to VM (through Role in AWS)
- SSH to VM
- Test Permissions by reading secret from cloud management CLI on VM and inlude screenshot to task README.txt



### Under construction, there were errors in implementing this in Sandbox or Learner Lab due to missing permissions.
