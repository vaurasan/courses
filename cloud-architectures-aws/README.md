### IaC Project - system deployment & 10 project prep tasks

- Based on [Public Cloud Solution Architect](https://pekkakorpi-tassi.fi/courses/pkt-arc/pkt-arc-edu-olt-2025-1e/course.html) course by **Pekka Korpi-Tassi** 2025.
- [Project Prep Tasks](https://pekkakorpi-tassi.fi/courses/pkt-arc/pkt-arc-edu-olt-2025-1e/iac_deployment.html).
- Using AWS Academy Sandbox & Learner Lab. These have limitations to what resources you can deploy, so it is kind of extra educational.
- Idea is to develop IaC template as the prep tasks progress. CloudFormation or Terraform.
- I chose to work with AWS CloudFormation .yaml template.
